## My Introduction to Wayman Bespoke

Scrolling through Instagram one day, I came across a post showing the person's new bespoke pattern wingtips, made by Wayman Bespoke. Immediately caught aside by the quality and level of detail in the shoes, I followed the Wayman Bespoke Instagram page and sent Simon a DM about getting more information about the shoes and the ordering process.

## The Ordering Process

### Designing the Shoes

From the beginning, you have complete freedom as to how you want to design your shoes. The first option is to choose one of their House Style models to build your shoe from. This is a very complete collection of pretty much every shoe design and style you can think of. From the Classic Oxford to a Double Monk Strap to a Balmoral Boot. On the other hand, if you do want something completely custom and unique to you, it is possible to go with a bespoke pattern. Working with Simon, you can create a custom pattern for the shoe style you want, whether that is for an Oxford, Derby, Loafer, Boot, whichever you prefer. This gives a much greater level of freedom and creative design choice but due to the extra time and effort required for this, it understandably costs more than just going for one of the house styles.

Once you have decided on which style you want to go for it is time to pick the specifics for your shoes.

#### Construction

All shoes are hand-lasted and hand-clicked but you need to choose from three choices of construction method for the shoes. These being listed below. These options cover all the bases you would want with a construction method going from the most elegant to most sturdy of choices.

* Hand-welted
* 180-degree Norwegian Hand-welted
* 360-degree Norwegian Hand-welted

#### Toe Shape

Currently, there are only three different types of Toe Shape you can choose from. However, in my mind, these 3 shapes cover most of what someone might want.

* Classic Round
* Modern Round
* Chiselled Square

#### Leather Choice

You are given a multitude of options when it comes to the type of leather you want. You can choose between.

* Box Calf
* Crust Calf
* Museum Calf
* Reverse Suede
* Grained Calf

These are all sourced from known high-quality tanneries like the Tannerie D'Annonay in France, Weinheimer Tannery in Germany, Ilcea Tannery in Italy, and the S.F. Stead Tannery from the UK to name a few.

All of these also come in a multitude of different colours from the classic dark browns and blacks to vibrant blues and purples.

#### Sole Design

The first choice around the sole is what type of sole you would like to use. This can either be a single leather sole, double leather sole, or a Dainite City sole. After the sole type has been chosen, you can decide on the waist style. The options are an incredibly tight and sharp looking fiddelback waist, a more conservative but still tight bevelled waist, or the standard square waist. With these options, no matter what style of shoe you go for, you can find a suitable waist style (I highly recommend the fiddleback as it looks amazing but that is just my opinion.)

Then you have the option of painting the sole. You can decide to paint just the waist of the entire sole of the shoe.

#### Heel/Edge Design

There are only 2 options for what style of heel you want.

* Square Heel Stack
* Pitched/Cuban Heel Stack

You will also need to choose what colour heel/edge you want. Ideally, these would be in coordination with the colour of the uppers.

#### Additional Extras

Once all the above is decided, you then can choose to add a few additional extras to your commission.

* Brass Peg Initials on the waist of the shoe for the added personal touch
* Extra sole protections
    * A Vibram Topsole
    * Triumph Toe Taps
    * Brass Pegs
* Lasted Shoe trees which are either spring-loaded or hinged
* A Pair of fitting shoes to be made against your personal last before jumping to the final commission

These all add extra cost to the shoes as they are not critical parts of the design of the shoe.

### Fitting Process

As these semi-bespoke shoes, you are unable to just choose standard sizes like 10E or 9F.

You need to take around six measurements as set out by the measurement guide [here](https://www.waymanbespoke.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intern.-Measurement-Guide.pdf). These measurements are then turned into a personal last for each of your feet, which the shoes are then built up against. Arguably providing a much better fit than you can find just buying a factory shoe (as long as your measurements are accurate).

Creating a last based upon measurements is incredibly difficult as each foot with have nuances that the measurements will not reflect.

## My Commission

### Overview of Commission

When deciding on the design of my commission, I wanted to go with something that will always be elegant but something a little different from my standard style of a Cap Toe Oxford. In the end, I decided on the following. Below is an overview of my commission.

* Quarter Brogue Cap Toe Oxford built with the Modern Round Toe Shape
* Custom swan neck stitching around the eyelets deviating from the standard
* Burgundy Box Calf Leather
* Pitched Heel Stack
* Single leather sole with a Fiddleback which was painted Dark Brown
* Spring Loaded Lasted Shoe Trees

### The Fit

The fit was better than I expected it would be. My main issue is I can never balance the length of the shoe with the width causing creasing to occur within the toe box. This is particularly annoying as it means I cannot have a true mirror shine on the toe cap. However, this issue does not occur on my commission which I am very happy about. It also has great arch support and holds my heel in place perfectly.

But, as I alluded to earlier, the fit is not perfect. There is slightly too much volume in the vamp causing excess creasing and the shoes do not fit as snug as I would want. This is a minor issue and is quickly fixed by adding an insole to the shoe. I have already communicated these issues to Simon, and my personal last has been amended so hopefully, the next pair will be even closer to perfect. As with every Semi-Bespoke/Made-To-Measure item, whether that is a suit, shirt, or shoes, it is a process and is all part of the fun.

### Looking at the fine details

Taking a closer look at the shoes and paying attention to the fine details you can start to begin to appreciate the high level of craftsmanship that went into making the shoes. The outsole stitching is done at a very high SPI of around 9/10. This also includes very fine fudging along the welt of the shoe which lines up perfectly with the outsole stitching, something indicative of a high-quality shoe.

The shoes also feature a seamless heel which is possibly my favourite aspect of the shoes. A seamless heel just takes the shoes to the next level of elegance and provides an extremely clean aesthetic.

The fiddleback waist has been executed beautifully and looks stunning. Extremely tight and sharp giving the shoes that extra bit of elegance and is another indicator of high-quality shoes.

Overall the shoes stitching and handwork is extremely tight and neat. I could see no loose stitching, inconsistent broguing, or dull/bad spots on the leather. This goes to speak of the high level of skill the artisans possess. Very impressive.

## Final Thoughts

Overall I am extremely happy with my first commission from Wayman Bespoke. At a cost of around 800 Euros, these are not accessible to everyone. However, to those who want to invest in truly high-quality shoes, I cannot recommend Wayman Bespoke enough. They feature very clean and elegant craftsmanship comparable to shoes that would cost twice as much if not even more. The fit is great and will only get better over time as you give feedback and modifications to Simon. Overall with what you get for the money, these shoes are an amazing value and it would be hard finding something comparable to its value proposition.

### Note on Simon and Customer Relations

One of the best things about Wayman Bespoke is Simon. The level of dedication and passion he possesses for shoes and channels to his clients is second to none. If you have any questions about anything to do with measurements, the shoes, design options, or just want to talk about shoes he is there and is happy to do so. I do not think Wayman Bespoke would be as successful as it is if it didn't have someone like Simon at the helm.
