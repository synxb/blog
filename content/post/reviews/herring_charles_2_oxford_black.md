## Introduction

The Black Cap-Toe Oxford is the most elegant and traditional shoe a man can own.
This model is styled by English shoe distributor Herring and made by Alfred Sargent.
Available in a Black Calf and an Oak Calf, this shoe is incredibly versatile and can be worn in nearly all situations.
It is crafted using traditional English shoe-making techniques, if taken care of properly, this shoe will last for years to come.

## Shoe Overview

If you don't have time to read the full review, here is a round up of the most important features of these shoes:

* Traditional Goodyear Welted Construction
* Classic Cap Toe Oxfords
* Five Eyelets
* Black Calfskin Upper
* Burgundy Leather Lining
* Standard Single Leather Sole
* Full Leather Heel Stack
* Open Channel Stitching (6-7 SPI)

## Full Review

### Unboxing Experience

My shoes were delivered via DHL and arrived with very good packaging. Herring provides a nice study shoe box and wraps each individual shoe in a soft cotton shoe bag.
It should be noted that as I ordered my shoes with a pair of Wildsmith Waxed Shoe Trees, they came in the Wildsmith Shoe bags which are noticeably softer than the Herring Branded shoe bags, so if you are looking at purchasing a pair and you are ordering shoe trees with them I would highly recommend to grab the Wildsmith Shoe Trees while you can.
Herring also ship all their shoes with a nice plastic shoe horn and a jar of their own brand shoe cream which is always a nice touch.

### Styling of the Shoe

This shoe is a classic Cap-Toe Oxford, a tried and tested style of shoe that will never go out of style.
It has straight stitched detailing closing off the eyelets to the rest of the upper.
With five eyelets it maintains the classic look without being to fashion focused.
Built on the 109F last it has great proportions and a nice rounded toe, keeping with classic English shoe-making standards.
The shape of the last gives the shoe a really nice silhouette with lots of curvature of the upper.
As far as styling goes this shoe does everything right.
Herring have kept to the traditional Oxford style and it works really well.

### Construction of the Shoe

The upper is made of incredibly soft and supple full grain black calfskin leather as would be expected of a shoe of this calibre.
I expect this shoe to shine incredibly well and will update after a few shines.
This shoe is good-year welted with a respected SPI of 6-7, inline with a few of my pairs of Joseph Cheaney dress shoes.
It features a standard leather sole with open channel stitching.
It would have been nice to see an Oak Bark Tanned leather sole with closed channel stitching. However, the lack of these features can clearly been seen as measures to keep the shoes price down and shouldn't affect the durability and lifespan of the shoes at all.
It has a flat narrow waist and a full leather heel stack. There is stiff hard countering on the toe and the heel, which is stitched tightly to the heel stack of the shoe with only a 1-2mm gap between the heel and heel stack.
Stitching throughout the shoe is very clean and to a high standard. Overall this shoe is built to last and I would expect to get many many year's worth of wears out of it.

### The Fit

I purchased these shoes in a UK size 9F. They fit really well with particularly great arch support when compared to my other English shoe makers, mainly Joseph Cheaney and Wildsmith.

### Conclusion

Overall I am very happy with my purchase. At £445 (including VAT) these shoes are a tricky buy, especially considering for an extra £25 you can purchase the Alfred Sargent Armfields which are built on the exact same last with closed channel stitching and an Oak Bark Tanned leather sole.
But as I was able to pick these up during Herrings 2020 Easter Sale they only cost £356 (including VAT, not including the shoe trees), which I think made them a very good value.
Herring has provided a very elegant and classically Cap-Toe Oxford which does everything right.
I definitely love these shoes and can't wait to break these in and hopefully get many many wears out of them over the years.

Thank you for reading my review on the Herring Charles 2 Oxfords in Black Calf.
